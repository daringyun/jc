jc lang is a brand-new compiled object-oriented language. It not only has Java's simple general syntax and object-oriented, but also has C system programming ability. It can directly operate hardware, absorb Rust's good memory management and does not need GC. It can be passed through the system. Threads and coroutines develop concurrent programs. With jc lang, programmers only need to learn one language, develop system drivers, mobile devices, web, large websites and saas platforms, big data, machine learning are no problem.
